texting prenatal providers friends colleagues opinions I scoured guidelines obstetrics professional societies refreshed MedTwitter In end I early adopter getting dose 15 weeks pregnancy I surprised relieved I felt afterward little tearful I texted vaxxie vaccine selfie family friends I feel safer caring patients primary care clinic In retrospect choice obvious Ultimately Id decided vaccine
